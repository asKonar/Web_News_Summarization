Facebook board of experts adjudicating content for Meta Platforms Inc, which owns Facebook, called for a six-month suspension of Hun Sen’s Facebook and Instagram accounts over a livestreamed speech in which he allegedly threatened violence. “I have no intention to shut down Facebook in Cambodia,” Hun Sen said in a voice message on the Telegram messaging app on Friday night  Prime Minister Hun Sen has threatened to block access to Facebook. Meta oversight board's recommendation to suspend the prime minister’s accounts comes less than a month before the next national election. Hun Sen said he had his own reasons for cutting ties with Facebook, adding that Meta did not need to suspend his account.  Hun Sen’s ruling party networks have also started promoting his new social media accounts. A Phnom Penh University student said their student association called a meeting on Friday and told students to “spread the word” about following Hun Sen. The student said the student association members were also told to monitor other students’ social media activity.</p>\n",

              "                <p class=\"all-sentences\"> US President Joe Biden’s middle child has been a persistent source of the wrong kind of attention for the first family. Latest chapter of the Hunter Biden saga came on June 22, when a WhatsApp message was released by a congressional committee investigating the presidential family. The message, allegedly from Hunter Biden to a Chinese business associate, showed him berating the associate in July 2017.  Hunter Biden co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners, a Washington, DC-based investment fund with business in China. Hunter Biden has also faced allegations of corruption based on his business affairs in Ukraine. Republican lawmakers have accused the Biden administration of obstructing attempts to find out more. They argue Hunter's business dealings have a direct effect on Biden’s policies.  Hunter Biden settled a child support case with an Arkansas woman who gave birth to his daughter. A laptop abandoned in a Delaware computer repair shop was shown to have racy photos of Hunter Biden as well as personal information. In a 2021 memoir, Hunter admitted to crack cocaine use and alcoholism, although he has received treatment and recovered from his addictions.  In 2021, a congressional committee released financial documents showing one of Trump’s hotels — located one block from the White House — made more than $3.7m from foreign governments while the Republican was in office. But focusing on Hunter Biden likely won’t sway many voters, “given the incredible amount of graft, corruption and questionable financial choices that we’ve seen in presidential administrations over the last six years”</p>\n",
